# Booking App

This is a conference ticket booking cli-app made with Go. I am making it to practice some go basics.

- Define a struct for the ticket owners
- Create a loop to ask for the ticket owners information and store it in a slice of structs
- Print out the remaining ticket information after the purchase
- Simulate a ticket being sent to the user by email (use time package)
- Use concurrency to send tickets and take new input at the same time
- Separate out each function into different packages
